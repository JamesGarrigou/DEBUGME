What is this:
	- Messy code which capitalize the first argument

The bug:
	- The letter 'z' is missing when we check if a char is lowercase

The debug:
22c22
< 		if (s[i] > 0x60 && s[i] < 0x7A)
---
> 		if (s[i] > 0x60 && s[i] < 0x7B)

Remarks:
	- Even if the code is messy, there is no other bug
	- Messy code makes it hard to understand -> Level3
	- The use of the terrible filename 'code.c' is intentional
