What is this:
	- Program outputing each c_i character n_i times for a string "n_0c_0...n_kc_k"
	- Example:
	$> ./a.out 3P0d35a4.
	$> PPPaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....

The bug:
	- The end of the output string is unitialized

The debug:
83a84
> 	output[j] = '\0';

Remarks:
	- The program seems to work because an unitialized byte is often read as 0
	- As simple as it seemed, this bug is really hard to find if the pisciner doesn't have the reflex to use valgrind -> Level4
